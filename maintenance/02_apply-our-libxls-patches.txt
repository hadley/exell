# file that has a patch related to filepaths (but also other patches)
# src/libxls/locale.c

# I implemented the filepath changes (and only the filepath changes) and did:
# git diff ':!maintenance/02_apply-our-libxls-patches.txt' > maintenance/patches/filepaths.patch
# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10415100/exclude-file-from-git-diff

# undo those changes

# apply the changes by applying a patch
# git apply maintenance/patches/filepaths.patch

# Implement the change where we mask functions cran doesn't like in this file:
# src/libxls/xlstypes.h
# then make the .patch file
# git diff ':!maintenance/02_apply-our-libxls-patches.txt' > maintenance/patches/cran.patch

# Implement the locale related changes in
# src/libxls/locale.c
# src/libxls/locale.h
# then make the .patch file
# git diff ':!maintenance/02_apply-our-libxls-patches.txt' > maintenance/patches/locale.patch
