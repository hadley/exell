\title{Read xls and xlsx files.}
\usage{
read_excel(path, sheet = 1L, col_names = TRUE, col_types = NULL,
  na = "", skip = 0)

read_xls(path, sheet = 1L, col_names = TRUE, col_types = NULL, na = "",
  skip = 0)

read_xlsx(path, sheet = 1L, col_names = TRUE, col_types = NULL, na = "",
  skip = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{Path to the xls/xlsx file}

\item{sheet}{Sheet to read. Either a string (the name of a sheet), or an
integer (the position of the sheet). Defaults to the first sheet.}

\item{col_names}{Either \code{TRUE} to use the first row as column names,
\code{FALSE} to number columns sequentially from \code{X1} to \code{Xn}, or
a character vector giving a name for each column.}

\item{col_types}{Either \code{NULL} to guess from the spreadsheet or a character
vector containing one entry per column from these options: "blank",
"numeric", "date" or "text".}

\item{na}{Character vector of strings to use for missing values. By default
readxl treats blank cells as missing data.}

\item{skip}{Number of rows to skip before reading any data.}
}
\description{
Read xls and xlsx files.

While \code{read_excel()} auto detects the format from the file
extension, \code{read_xls()} and \code{read_xlsx()} can be used to
read files without extension.
}
\examples{
datasets <- readxl_example("datasets.xlsx")
read_excel(datasets)

# Specific sheet either by position or by name
read_excel(datasets, 2)
read_excel(datasets, "mtcars")

# Skipping rows and using default column names
read_excel(datasets, skip = 148, col_names = FALSE)
}
