# readxl 0.1.1.9000

* Improved handling of empty cells for xlsx. (#248 @jennybc)

    - Cells with no content are not loaded. Sheet extent is always computed from loaded cells, instead of the nominal dimensions reported in the worksheet. The result is to not consult the XML for empty cells that appear there simply because they have an associated style or format. This is detectable in Excel as seemingly empty cells with a format other than "General".
    - Eliminates a source of trailing rows (#203, although original report was re: xls, which is not fixed yet) and columns (#236, #162, #146) consisting entirely of `NA`.
    - Eliminates a subtle source of disagreement between user-provided column names and guessed column types (#169, #81). 

* `tibble::repair_names()` is used to prevent empty, `NA`, or duplicated names. (#216, #208, #199 #182, #53, #247 @jennybc)

* Fix compilation warning/failure (FreeBSD 10.3 #221, gcc 4.9.3 #124) and/or problems reading xls (CentOS 6.6 #189). (#244, #245, #246 @jeroenooms)

* Improved parsing of sheet geometry for xlsx. (#240, @jennybc)

    - Location is inferred for cells that do not declare their location (e.g. xlsx written by JMP). (#163, #102)
    - Worksheets that are completely empty or that contain only column names no longer error, but return a tibble with zero rows. (#222, #144, #65)
    - Better handling of leading and embedded blank rows and explicit row skipping. (#224, #194, #178, #156, #101)

* `read_xls()` and `read_xlsx()` are now exposed, such that files without an `.xls` or `.xlsx` extension can be read. (#85, @jirkalewandowski)

* Logic for sheet lookup in xlsx is more robust. Improves compatibility with xlsx written by tools other than Excel and/or xlsx containing chartsheets. (#233, #104, #200, #168, #116, @jimhester, @jennybc)

* Support multiple NA values, e.g., `read_excel("missing-values.xls", na = c("NA", "1"))`. (#13, #56, @jmarshallnz)

* Parse dates from .xlsx files saved with LibreOffice. (#134, @zeehio)

* Default column names on .xlsx files now start with X1 instead of X0. (#98, @zeehio, @krlmlr)

* Unwanted printed output (e.g., `DEFINEDNAME: 21 00 00 ...`) is suppressed when reading .xls that contains a defined range. (#82, #188, @PedramNavid)

* Don't access value of `numFmtId` attribute when it does not exist. Can occur in xlsx written by <http://epplus.codeplex.com/>. (#191, #229)

* Import the `tibble` package (#175, @krlmlr).

# readxl 0.1.1

* Add support for correctly reading strings in .xlsx files containing escaped 
  unicode characters (e.g. `_x005F_`). (#51, thanks to @jmarshallnz)
